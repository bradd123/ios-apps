# iOS Persistence and Core Data

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Udacity's iOS Persistence and Core Data course.

## Overview

iOS Persistence and Core Data teach common persistence techniques using Apple's frameworks. The course includes one-off examples like PickYourPitch and the SandboxPlayground, but the main case-study is the CoolNotes app. CoolNotes is a simple clone of the standard Notes app that comes pre-installed on iOS.

## Setup

Generally speaking, most projects can run without any additional setup. However, consult the iOS Persistence and Core Data course for more information.
